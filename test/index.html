            <tr><td colspan="2"><p align="justify">The 2218-m-high Nabro stratovolcano is the highest volcano in the Danakil depression of northern Ethiopia.  Located at the SE end of the Danakil Alps, Nabro lies in the Danakil horst.  Nabro is the most prominent and NE-most of three volcanoes with large summit calderas aligned in a NE-SW direction SW of Dubbi volcano.  These three volcanoes, along with Sork Ale volcano, collectively comprise the Bidu volcanic complex.  The complex Nabro stratovolcano is truncated by nested calderas, 8 and 5 km in diameter.  The larger caldera is widely breached to the SW.  Nabro was constructed primarily of trachytic lava flows and pyroclastics.  Post-caldera rhyolitic obsidian domes and basaltic lava flows were erupted inside the caldera and on its flanks.  Some very recent lava flows were erupted from NNW-trending fissures transverse to the trend of the Nabro volcanic range.</p></td></tr>
